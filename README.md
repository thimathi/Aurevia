# Technical Architecture

*Frontend
        Framework: Flutter (Dart) for cross-platform compatibility or Kotlin for Android.
        Design: Focus on minimalistic and user-friendly interfaces.

*Backend
        1. Authentication
              Alternative:  Auth0 Free Tier or Supabase Authentication
                            Provides email/password authentication, social logins, and even third-party integrations for free.
                            Supabase offers 10,000 monthly active users (MAUs) on its free tier.
        2. Real-Time Database
              Alternative:  Supabase Database or PostgreSQL
                            Supabase provides a managed PostgreSQL database with real-time functionality.
                            It’s highly customizable and scales well, with a generous free tier.
              Alternative:  SQLite for local storage.
                            Use SQLite for local-only data storage if real-time sync is unnecessary.
        3. Cloud Storage
              Alternative:  AWS Free Tier
                            Amazon S3 provides 5GB of free storage.
                            You can integrate it with your backend or use their SDK for uploading files.
                            Alternative: Google Drive API (if small-scale file storage suffices).
                            Allows users to store and retrieve files in their own Google Drive.
        4. Notifications
              Alternative:  OneSignal
                            Free push notification service for mobile and web apps.
                            It supports real-time notifications and scheduling.
              Alternative:  Native Android Firebase-Free Solutions
                            Leverage Android’s AlarmManager or WorkManager to schedule notifications without Firebase.
        5. Location Services
                            Keep Firebase Replacement as Google Maps API.
                            Google Maps API is independent of Firebase. It works seamlessly for location-based features.
        6. AI/ML Integration
              Alternative:  TensorFlow Lite
                            This works offline on mobile devices and is free for use.
